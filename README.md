This is a Python classifier that uses a Naive Bayes algorithm for assessing if a SMS is spam or ham.
This is a sample code to assess my knowledge of Naive Bayes classifier.

Added run-sk.py to compare my implementation with Naive Bayes implemented in Python Scikit-learn library.

The SMS dataset is taken from [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection)

Compatible from Python 3.0
